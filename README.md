# editorial-agent
Read NYT and Guardian editorials distraction free with important sentences and words highlighted to improve your writing/english skills

#### P.S 
This project was inspired by the Writing in the Sciences course by Stanford University on Coursera and my love for writing. **It is a functioning project**. It is however a quickly put together POC so the code is really ugly. Needs a lot of work to structure it properly.
